A browser-environment JavaScript-based Anime Avatar designed using Liv2D controlled through facial expressions that can speak.

# Overview
An Avatar assistant designed using Liv2D controlled through facial expressions. Tensorflow.js tracks
expressions and feeds to Liv2D Cubism SDK, which controls the avatar in a browser
environment. Further speech is added through Web Speech API. 

## Note
Just remember to clone the [face_api](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js.git) repo inside the face_integration folder. 

Happy hacking;)
